    <h1>Code Optimization</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied.</li>
            <li>Reduce the memory usage of the program and increase its total run time.</li>
            <li>Reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms.</li>
        </ol>
